## Technical Process
* **Geodetic Frameworks:** Re-projected OSM data from `GCS_WGS_1984` to `NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Illinois_East`.
* **Standardization:** Utilized **Arcade Expressions** to resolve 12-digit Census ID mismatches.
* **Spatial Integration:** Applied the **CLOSEST** spatial join operator to ensure 100% attribute coverage across the unified layer.
* **Quality Control:** Validated vector integrity using **Topology Rules** (Must Not Overlap).
