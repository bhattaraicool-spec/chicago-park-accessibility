# Integrating Municipal and Crowdsourced Data to Create a Unified Park Feature Layer
**Author:** Image Bhattarai  
**Department:** Geography and Geospatial Sciences  

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a unified park feature class for Chicago by merging official municipal data with OpenStreetMap (OSM) crowdsourced data. The goal is to provide a reliable dataset for analyzing urban green space accessibility.

## Technical Methodology

### 1. Geodetic Frameworks
* **Projecting Data:** Re-projected OSM data from `GCS_WGS_1984` to `NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Illinois_East` to ensure spatial alignment with a sub-meter accuracy.

### 2. Data Integration & Standardization
* **Arcade Expressions:** Used to fix 12-digit Census ID mismatches, allowing for seamless tabular joins.
* **Spatial Join:** Utilized the **CLOSEST** operator to eliminate "spatial nulls" and ensure accurate attribute assignment across disparate datasets.

### 3. Quality Control
* Established a **Geodatabase Topology** with rules such as "Must Not Overlap" to validate the geometric integrity of the final integrated layer.
